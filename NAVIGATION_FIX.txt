✅ FIXED: Navigation Loop Issue

The issue was in App.js - when authenticated users tried to access /login, it would:
1. Redirect to getDashboardRoute()
2. getDashboardRoute() would calculate /admin or /dashboard
3. But then the route protection would redirect back
4. Creating an infinite loop

FIX APPLIED:
- Removed getDashboardRoute() function
- Added 'replace' prop to all <Navigate> components
- Made route logic explicit and unambiguous
- Added proper fallback redirects for all scenarios

DEPLOYED:
- New build: main.79eb1305.js (Jan 7, 21:01)
- Deployed to: /var/www/shef-lms/
- Nginx cache headers updated
- index.html: no-cache (always fresh)
- static assets: 7 days cache

TESTING:
Please clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) and try:
1. https://learnwithshef.com/ - Should redirect to login
2. Login with any demo account
3. Should redirect to appropriate dashboard (no loop)
